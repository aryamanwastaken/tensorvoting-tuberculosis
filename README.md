# Automated tuberculosis interpretation using tensor voting

## Final Year Elective Project

Applying tensor voting, a pattern recognition technique that allows you to automatically detect and classify patterns. We will test and evaluate the performance of this method on the Tuberculosis Image dataset from Kaggle.

# About Dataset

## Context

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.

The bacteria that cause TB are spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Most people infected with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis don't have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they usually include a cough (sometimes blood-tinged), weight loss, night sweats, and fever. Treatment isn't always required for those without symptoms. Patients with active symptoms will require a long course of treatment involving multiple antibiotics.

## Content

This dataset all about Tuberculosis, where it is taken from a sputum sample. Special software and hardware is design to take a sample from sputum. As it contains 928 sputum images with bounding boxes of 3734 bacilli. while XML file contains bounding box details of images. See the sample Image:-
